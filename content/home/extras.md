When I'm not geeking about machine learning, you'll likely find me exploring trails or biking through the serenity of nature. My next big adventure? Hiking the Tatra Mountains in Slovakia/Poland! 

If you're into outdoor escapades, feel free to check out my journey on [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/user/3335970086925) and If you got a cool trail in mind? Drop me a message, let's turn it into an adventure worth logging!
