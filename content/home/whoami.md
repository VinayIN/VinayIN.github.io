> Masters Student - Artificial Intelligence | Software Engineer - II | Data Science Engineer | Machine Learning Engineer | MLOps | Python Developer | Ethical AI 

Namaste, I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the [Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg (BTU)](https://www.b-tu.de/).

I transitioned from the professional world to pursue my Master's degree, captivated by the current surge in academia and the opportunity to contribute to the AI revolution. I am a strong advocate for [ethical applications of AI](https://www.iso.org/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-ethics) and believe in its positive implications to society. Currently, I reside in [Cottbus, Germany](https://www.cottbus.de/kultur/index.html), while further enriching my experience as a research assistant at the university.

My primary programming language for scripting is Python. I also possess experience in C++, Matlab, and Golang. Additionally, I actively participate in hackathons, where I get to experiment with new ideas.
