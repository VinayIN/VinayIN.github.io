> Masters Student - Artificial Intelligence | Software Engineer - II | Data Science Engineer | Machine Learning Engineer | MLOps | Python Developer | Ethical AI 

Namaste, I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the [Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg (BTU)](https://www.b-tu.de/).

I transitioned from the professional world to pursue my Master's degree, captivated by the current surge in academic exploration and the opportunity to contribute to the AI revolution. I am a strong advocate for ethical applications of AI and believe in the importance of raising awareness in this crucial field. Currently, I reside in [Cottbus, Germany](https://www.cottbus.de/kultur/index.html), while further enriching my experience as a research assistant at the university.

My primary programming language is Python for scripting. I also possess experience in C++, Matlab, and Java. Additionally, I actively participate in hackathons, explore new technologies, enjoy hiking and cycling, and find calmness in photography and still-life sketching.
