> Machine Learning Engineer • AI Engineer • Data Scientist | System Design | ASR | Model Compression | Deep Reinforcement Learning | Python/Rust | MLOps | Ethical AI

Namaste, I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the [Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg (BTU)](https://www.b-tu.de/).

I transitioned from the professional world to pursue my Master's degree, captivated by the current surge in academia and the opportunity to contribute to the AI revolution. I am a strong advocate for [ethical applications of AI](https://www.iso.org/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-ethics) and believe in its positive implications to society. Currently, I reside in [Cottbus, Germany](https://www.cottbus.de/kultur/index.html), and working on my masters thesis.

My expertise and interests lies on `system desiging`, `speech recognition (ASR) models`, `model compression` *(mainly: pruning and quantization)* and using `reinforcement learning` approches for operations optimization. My primary programming language for scripting is Python, but I also get rusty with Rust to gain performance during system designing activity.

If I align with your needs, feel free to [contact me](mailto:binaypradhan@duck.com), and If my open-source projects help you, consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/i_binay).
