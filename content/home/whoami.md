> Machine Learning Engineer | AI Engineer | Data Scientist | AI Researcher

Namaste, I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the [Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg (BTU)](https://www.b-tu.de/).

I transitioned from the professional world to pursue my Master's degree, captivated by the current surge in academia and the opportunity to contribute to the AI revolution. I am a strong advocate for [ethical applications of AI](https://www.iso.org/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-ethics) and believe in its positive implications to society. Currently, I reside in [Cottbus, Germany](https://www.cottbus.de/kultur/index.html), and working on my masters thesis.

My expertise and interests include `system design`, `speech recognition models (ASR)`, `model compression` *(pruning and quantization)*, and the application of `reinforcement learning` approaches for operations optimization. My primary programming language is `Python`, complemented by the use of `Rust` to enhance performance in system design. Additionally, I actively participate in hackathons to further develop my skills and stay engaged with the latest advancements in the field.
