> Masters Student - Artificial Intelligence | Software Engineer - II | Data Science Engineer | Machine Learning Engineer | Python Programmer | Adventurer

Namaste, I'm a Masters Student in Artificial Intelligence at Brandenburgische Technische Universit√§t (BTU) Cottbus-Senftenberg.

I left the professional sphere to pursue my masters because I believe there's more to machine learning than just knowing how to create models and endpoints. Working on projects during my previous employment helped me understand what to look forward to in my career. Now, I am an expat in Cottbus, Germany.

I primarily use Python for scripting and have some experience with C++, Matlab, and Java. I also participate in hackathons, experiment with new technologies, hike, cycle, and enjoy photography and sketching still objects.

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:pradhan.binay.de@gmail.com?cc=bpradhan.asli@gmail.com) anytime if you want to collaborate on any projects.
